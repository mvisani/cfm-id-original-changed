### What is CFM-ID ###
CFM-ID provides a method for accurately and efficiently identifying metabolites in spectra generated by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The program uses Competitive Fragmentation Modeling to produce a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process and machine learning techniques to adapt the model parameters from data.

#### CFM-ID can be used for: ####
* Predicting the spectra for a given chemical structure. This task predicts low/10V, medium/20V, and high/40V energy ESI-MS/MS spectra for an input structure provided in SMILES or InChI format. 
* Peak Assignment: Annotating the peaks in set of spectra given a known chemical structure. This task takes a set of three input spectra (for ESI spectra, low/10V, medium/20V, and high/40V energy levels) in peak list format and a chemical structure in SMILES or InChI format, then assigns a putative fragment annotation to the peaks in each spectrum. 
* Compound Identification:	Predicted ranking of possible candidate structures for a target spectrum. This task takes a set of three input spectra (for ESI spectra, low/10V, medium/20V, and high/40V energy levels) in peak list format, and ranks a list of candidate structures according to how well they match the input spectra. This candidate list need to be provided by the user. Chemical classes are predicted for each candidate molecule. The original similarity score used in the ranking was computed (Dice or DotProduct) by comparing the predicted spectra of a candidate compound with the input spectra.
